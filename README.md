# recount_importer

This script imports recount data and transforms it into a manageable format to be uploaded to NeMO Analytics.

This script is currently in a 2-script development phase in which libraries and files must be installed and downloaded from R, to which the user can then run the Python script with the locally installed files to obtain the items to upload.

In this repository, you will find directions on how to install these libraries, obtain the files and run the Python script.
